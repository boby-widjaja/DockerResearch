sudo dnf update

Fedora’s package manager (dnf) talks to online repositories and downloads:

✔ list of available packages
✔ their versions
✔ dependencies
✔ security updates
✔ checksums & signatures

This information is called repository metadata.

It is basically:
a local database of what software exists and what versions are available.
Why it matters before installing software
Without fresh metadata:
your system may not see new packages
may install outdated versions
may fail dependency resolution
may miss security fixes
Updating metadata ensures:

✅ you install the latest compatible software
✅ dependency graph is correct
✅ fewer errors
